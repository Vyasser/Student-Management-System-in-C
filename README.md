# 📌 Project Title:
**Student Management System in C**

---

## 📄 Description:
A simple console-based application written in C that allows you to manage student records efficiently.  
The program enables users to **add**, **delete**, **update**, and **search** student information, all stored in **binary files**.  
It’s designed to demonstrate practical use of file handling, data structures, and menu-based navigation in C programming.

---

## 🚀 Features:
- Add new student with full information  
- Display all student records  
- Search student by ID  
- Update existing student data  
- Delete student record  
- Data persistence using binary file storage (`.bin`)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Language: **C**
- File Handling: **Binary Files**
- Compiler: GCC / Code::Blocks / Dev-C++
